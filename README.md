# -IPL-Data-analysis
In this project, I will take an IPL dataset and analyze the metrics of different teams in IPL . I will also be using libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis on top of this IPL data.. I will be implementing some machine algorithms to predict which team has a better liklihood of winning the tournament.
